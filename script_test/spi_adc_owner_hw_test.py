"""Hardware regression: the shared SPI/ADC bulk buffers must never wedge.

  py script_test/spi_adc_owner_hw_test.py

Background (2026-10-06 field failure): SPI bridge STATUS reported enabled=0,
active=0, cs=0, frames_ok=0 and the ADC stream reported owned=0, yet HID CAPS
kept returning flags=2. The web therefore refused to start ADC and no host
command could clear the bit -> the probe had to be unplugged.

The firmware now defines bit1 as "the bridge really owns the buffers"
(s_enabled / s_pkt_active / s_adc_owner) and lets the ADC reclaim stale
bookkeeping. This test drives the real HID control plane and asserts:

  1. DRAIN leaves the IN ring busy *without* flipping the takeover bit
     (this is exactly the state the old firmware reported as flags=3);
  2. a genuinely enabled bridge still reports bit1 and refuses ADC OPEN
     -> the ADC / SPI-QSPI mutual exclusion users asked for is intact;
  3. disabling the bridge always drops bit1 again, whatever was left behind.
